# Lomo-backup - Cost saving 2-stages cloud backup solution

[![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/lomorage/lomo-backup/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lomorage/lomo-backup/actions?query=workflow%3AGo)

Lomo-backup is a backup solution designed to protect your valuable photos and videos using a two-stage approach. This strategy combines the benefits of free cloud storage with long-term archival in AWS Glacier.

# Motivation
Photos and videos are very important personal assets, and we prefer to store them at home rather than in the cloud. We developed the Lomorage application to self-host our own Google Photos alternative, successfully achieving our primary goal.

However, backups are crucial because we don't want to risk losing any photos accidentally. The current Lomorage application can perform daily backups to another disk or NAS via rsync, but these backups are still hosted at home. We need disaster recovery capabilities, making cloud storage a natural choice. Unfortunately, cloud storage is not always reliable; there are occasional reports of lost user data. Therefore, a solution that can run consistent checks monthly and send alerts if any discrepancies are found would be very beneficial.

Our initial plan was to implement a peer backup solution, allowing us to back up photos and videos to the homes of parents, siblings, or friends. While this remains our ultimate goal, a single backup copy is insufficient, and cloud storage typically offers a higher SLA than peer storage. Thus, the ideal solution should meet the following requirements:

- Cost-effectiveness
- Automatic backup when new files are detected
- Monthly consistency checks with alerts if the cloud version differs from the local version
- Support for multi-site backups

Since I already have local duplicate backups and usually access photos and videos from the local service, I rarely need to access the cloud backup version.

# Cost Analysis using current backup solution
Let us calculate the cost using AWS Glacier. As of 2024/4/4

- $0.0036 per GB / Month
- $0.03 (PUT, COPY, POST, LIST requests (per 1,000 requests))
- $0.0004 (GET, SELECT, and all other requests (per 1,000 requests)) (need recalculate)

assuming I have 50,000 photos (2M each) + 5,000 videos (30M each)ï¼Œ total storage is 250G, and total price will be 250 * 0.0036 = $0.9 / month, and total upload costs will be 55000 * 0.03 = $16.5. (need recalculate: consistency check will mainly use GET and LIST API, price will be 55000 * 0.0004 = $22 / month)

assuming I have 250 new photos (2M each) + 50 videos (30M each) per month, total new storage is 2G, total price will be 2 * 0.0036 = $0.0072, and all PUT API cost will be 300 * 0.03 = $9. (need recalculate: consistency check will be 300 * 0.0004 = $0.12).

# 2 Stages Approach
Due to the large number of image and video files, API operations become the primary cost compared to actual storage costs. To mitigate this, we propose packing all images and videos into a single large ISO file, similar to burning a CD-ROM for backup in the old days. By creating a 10GB ISO, the storage cost remains the same, but upload costs are minimized to $0.75 (calculated as 250/10 * 0.03). The consistency check cost is $0.01 (250/10 * 0.0004).

However, the ISO approach has a limitation: to append new files, you need the original ISO file. This means either keeping a local copy or downloading it when a backup is needed, both of which incur additional costs.

At the same time, many cloud providers offer free storage tiers. For example, Google Drive offers 15GB of free space, AWS offers 15GB, and Microsoft OneDrive offers 5GB.

To best utilize these servers, we created a "2-stage approach" solution:

- Using free storage for metadata and short-term backups as an intermediary or staging area before creating the ISO and backing it up to Glacier.
- Using Glacier deep archive for permanent file storage.

We plan to upload once every five months, requiring only one API operation, which is negligible in cost.

One note is I like to keep all photos/videos in remote backup when they are packed in ISO even I delete the ones at local because
1. Photos/videos will not be packed into ISO until total size of unpacked ones reach configured iso size, thus user have time to delete the ones they don't want
2. Number of deleted ones should not be that big, thus cost should be very small if storing in Glacier

Workflow:

1. Perform daily backups to free storage initially.
2. When reaching the configured disk threshold, archive the files into an ISO file, save it to Glacier, and delete the backup files from free storage.
3. Maintain a metadata file or SQLite database specifying which files are in which ISO file or free storage.

Pre-requsition commands:
- mkisofs: generate iso file

Features:

- :heavy_check_mark: pack all photos/videos into multiple ISOs and upload to S3
- :heavy_check_mark: metadata to track which file is in which iso
- :heavy_check_mark: backup files not in ISO to staging station, Google drive
- :heavy_check_mark: pack all photos/videos into multiple ISOs and upload to Glancier
- :heavy_check_mark: encrypt iso files before upload to Glacier, Google drive
- [ ] metadata to track which files are in staging station
- [ ] daemon running mode to watch folder change only, avoid scanning all folder daily
- [ ] daily consistency check on staging station
- [ ] monthly consistency check on Glacier. send email alert if anything is wrong.
- [ ] multi platform support: remove mkisofs requirements

# Feature highlights
- Multipart upload to S3
- Resume upload if one part was fail
- Checksum validation during upload
- Self define iso size
- On the fly encryption all files as iso file size may be big, and we want to avoid intermittent file in order to save time and not require extra disks
- Original file hash and encrypted file hash are kept in cloud for future consistency check

# Security Model
The security model is from repository [filecrypt](https://github.com/kisom/filecrypt). For more details, refer to the book [Practical Cryptography With Go](https://leanpub.com/gocrypto/read).

This program assumes that an attacker does not currently have access
to either the machine the archive is generated on, or on the machine
it is unpacked on. It is intended for medium to long-term storage of
sensitive data at rest on removeable media that may be used to load data
onto a variety of platforms (Windows, OS X, Linux, OpenBSD), where the
threat of losing the storage medium is considerably higher than losing a
secured laptop that the archive is generated on.

Key derivation is done by pairing a password with a randomly-chosen
256-bit salt using the scrypt parameters N=2^20, r=8, p=1. This makes
it astronomically unlikely that the same key will be derived from the
same passphrase. The key is used as a NaCl secretbox key; the nonce for
encryption is randomly generated. It is thought that this will be highly
unlikely to cause nonce reuse issues.

The primary weaknesses might come from an attack on the passphrase or
via cryptanalysis of the ciphertext. The ciphertext is produced using
NaCl appended to a random salt, so it is unlikely this will produce any
meaningful information. One exception might be if this program is used
to encrypt a known set of files, and the attacker compares the length of
the archive to a list of known file sizes.

An attack on the passphrase will most likely come via a successful
dictionary attack. The large salt and high scrypt parameters will
deter attackers without the large resources required to brute force
this. Dictionary attacks will also be expensive for these same reasons.

### Key & Salt & Nonce
`Lomo-backup` encrypts all data and metadata, in which listing the original filename, during upload and decrypts them on-the-fly upon retrieval. Each file upload has a unique encryption key derived from a master key. The master key is either input via the command line or derived from the environment variable `LOMOB_MASTER_KEY`. The key derivation function (KDF) used is Argon2, the winner of the Password Hashing Competition. Each file's salt for the KDF is the first 16 byte of its SHA256 checksum.

### Notes
- ISO and iso metadata filename is not encrypted

# Pre-requisition
## AWS Glacier API Access ID and Access Secret
AWS has good tutorial to get key. After you get it, you can set them into environment variable:

- AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

Note `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` is to specify which region your upload will reside. You can also specify it when you run the upload command.

## Google Cloud API OAuth credentials and token
You can skip if you have tokens already. Below are my steps to get credentials. Note that most steps are from https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/go, but seems the guide missed some steps, thus I have to add these steps in case readers need them.

### Enable the API
Before using Google APIs, you need to turn them on in a Google Cloud project. You can turn on one or more APIs in a single Google Cloud project. In the Google Cloud console, enable the Google Drive API. https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=drive.googleapis.com

### Configure the OAuth consent screen
If you're using a new Google Cloud project to complete this quickstart, configure the OAuth consent screen and add yourself as a test user. If you've already completed this step for your Cloud project, skip to the next section. Note that `add yourself as a test user` is very import to ensure oauth authorization success.

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to Menu menu > APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen. https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent
2. For User type select `External`, then click Create. Note that original guide specifies `Internal` User Type, but seems it won't allow me to select `Internal`, so I select `External`, and it works.
3. Complete the app registration form, then click Save and Continue.
4. For now, you can skip adding scopes and click Save and Continue.
5. Review your app registration summary. To make changes, click Edit. If the app registration looks OK, click Back to Dashboard.

### Authorize credentials for a desktop application
To authenticate end users and access user data in your app, you need to create one or more OAuth 2.0 Client IDs. A client ID is used to identify a single app to Google's OAuth servers. If your app runs on multiple platforms, you must create a separate client ID for each platform.

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to Menu menu > APIs & Services > Credentials. https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Click Create Credentials > OAuth client ID.
3. Click Application type > Desktop app.
4. In the Name field, type a name for the credential. This name is only shown in the Google Cloud console.
5. Click Create. The OAuth client created screen appears, showing your new Client ID and Client secret.
6. Click OK. The newly created credential appears under OAuth 2.0 Client IDs.
7. Save the downloaded JSON file as `gdrive-credentials.json`, and move the file to your working directory.

Note that the redirect_uris in `gdrive-credentials.json` are `http://localhost`. I can not find any places to change it, so our app will use it as default.

### Get access token
`lomo-backup`` app has one command utility to get token. Its usage is as below 
```
$  ./lomob util gcloud-auth --help
NAME:
   lomob util gcloud-auth - 

USAGE:
   lomob util gcloud-auth [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --cred value           Google cloud oauth credential json file (default: "gdrive-credentials.json")
   --token value          Token file to access google cloud (default: "gdrive-token.json")
   --redirect-path value  Redirect path defined in credentials.json (default: "/")
   --redirect-port value  Redirect port defined in credentials.json (default: 80)
```

Notes:
 - If your redirect_url is `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`, you can run `./lomob util gcloud-auth --redirect-port 8080 --redirect-path /auth/callback`
 - If your redirect port is `80`, you probably need run the tool with sudo permission if you see permission deny failure message `WARN[0000] Failed to listen 80: listen tcp :80: bind: permission denied`.
 - If you run `lomob` as sudo, `gdrive-token.json` may be saved as `root` user, and you can change to your own user if you like.

Below is output after you run `lomob`
```
$ sudo ./lomob util gcloud-auth 
Starting listen on http://localhost:80
Go to the following link in your browser then follow the instruction: 
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?access_type=offline&client_id=xxxx&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost&response_type=code&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive&state=state-token
```
Copy the link into your browser, and follow the google authorization steps, token will be retrieved if you see below messages
```
Handle google callback: /?state=state-token&code=xxxxxx&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
Start exchange: xxxx
Exchange success, saving token into gdrive-token.json
```

Once you get token, you can verify if it works or not via `./lomob list gdrive`

# Basic Backup Steps
The basic workflow is simple: 1. scan, 2. pack ISO, 3. upload ISO or files. Anytime you can list remote directories in cloud in tree view, and download and restore them.

1. **Install the software:** 
    ```sh
    go install github.com/lomorage/lomo-backup/cmd/lomob@latest
    ```
2. **Create a directory to store generated database file and iso files:** 
    ```sh
    mkdir lomo-backup
    cd lomo-backup
    ```
3. **Scan the directory containing images and videos:** 
    ```sh
    lomob scan ~/Pictures
    ```
4. **Create ISO files:** 
    ```sh
    lomob iso create
    ```
    - Default ISO file size is 5GB. Use `-s` to change this value.
    - Refer to the detailed usage section for larger sizes.
5. **Set AWS credentials:** Set them in the environment variables as per the previous section.
6. **Upload ISO files to AWS:** 
    ```sh
    lomob upload iso
    ```
    - Default upload part size is 100MB. Use `-p` to change this.
    - Files are encrypted by default. Use `--no-encrypt` to upload raw files.
    - Default storage class is S3 `STANDARD`. Use `--storage-class` to change to `DEEP_ARCHIVE`.
    - Refer to the detailed usage section for other settings.
7. **Get Google Cloud OAuth credentials:** Obtain the JSON file and token file.
8. **Upload unpacked files to Google Cloud:** 
    ```sh
    lomob upload files
    ```
